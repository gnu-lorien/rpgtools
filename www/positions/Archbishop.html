Archbishops have the authority to administrate specific cities
or small territories known as a diocese. Archbishops are
always members of founded packs within the area they control.
Archbishops report to the Cardinal of the Holy See of which
their diocese is a part. Archbishops coordinate military strategy
for their diocese and perform Auctoritas Ritae at major esbats
(gatherings). To become an Archbishop, a vampire is required
to have an in-depth knowledge of sect ritae.
Where a Camarilla Prince is a domineering and tyrannical
authority, a Sabbat Archbishop must be more cunning
and subtle. The Sabbat, unconcerned with enforcing the
Traditions, instead wages a holy war. Thus, an Archbishop
is part spiritual leader and part warlord. Some vampires fail
to understand the necessary compromises demanded of an
Archbishop’s position, and this can cause them to lose faith
in their leadership. The education of ignorance may be an
Archbishop’s greatest challenge to overcome.
A vampire becomes Archbishop by competing for the
position, typically through Monomacy. Once she has
claimed the title, she must seek ordination by the Cardinal
of the Holy See.
An Archbishop’s authority includes:
• Awarding or removing fleeting or negative status to
those within her diocese
• Calling an esbat within her diocese
• Assisting and advising the Cardinal of the surrounding
Holy See
• Appointing or removing up to five Bishops for her diocese
• Performing the Blood Bath on her Bishops
• Authorizing Wild Hunts within her diocese
• Appointing up to two Templars
• Ordering any member of her diocese to undergo a Rite
of Contrition
• Exiling a member of the Sabbat from her diocese
(permanently or otherwise)
• Administering physical punishments to members of her
diocese
• Summoning a lesser member of the Black Hand or the
Inquisition (but cannot command them)
• Holding status jurisdiction over her physical domain
An Archbishop gains the abiding status traits Authority,
Glorious, and Ordained during her tenure in office.
