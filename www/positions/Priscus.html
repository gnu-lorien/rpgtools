The 13 Prisci serve the populace of the Sabbat as sages and
chamberlains, and are not part of the hierarchy of the clergy.
A new Prisci is appointed or removed by a majority vote of the
Prisci Council. Typically, a Prisci is an older member of the sect,
vested with centuries of wisdom and influence. Her duty is to
advise the Regent and offer wisdom to the Sword of Caine.
On occasion, younger Prisci may be chosen, provided their
knowledge is of critical importance to the Sword of Caine.
Prisci serve on the Consistory, and they are often given
secondary titles to indicate their area of expertise (Prisci
of Ritae, Prisci of Doctrine, Prisci of Tactics, and so forth).
The Regent often uses the Prisci as heralds, or as mediators
for inter-sect issues and rivalries, trusting the Prisci to find
reasonable solutions. When the Sabbat meet at a synod or
ecumenical council to discuss articles of faith, they present
those decisions to the Prisci at the end of the gathering. The
Prisci then ratify each item, codifying the decisions of the
sect into ecumenical law (or overruling them).
With a unanimous vote, the Prisci Council can overrule the
Regent’s decree on any issue except Crusade. This ability is
rarely used, as an annoyed Regent is a powerful enemy. In
unusual circumstances, a group of three Prisci may, by acting
together, remove the ordination of a Cardinal, Archbishop,
or Bishop. The Regent can, of course, reinstate that
individual (and punish the offending Prisci) if he disagrees.
A Priscus is empowered to:
• Uninitiate any vampire proven to be ignorant or
dangerous to the Sabbat
• Order any member of the sect to undergo a Rite of
Contrition
• Order the Regent, via a full majority vote of the Prisci
Council, to undergo Contrition if they feel he has
committed an offense
• As a group, the Prisci perform the Blood Bath to ordain
the Regent
A Priscus gains the abiding status traits of Infamous,
Prominent, and Sacrosanct during her tenure in office. A
Priscus can remove the acceptance of Initiated from any
individual who proves significant ignorance of sect doctrine
or the Code of Milan, or who is proven to be dangerous to
the security of the Sabbat, without expending a status trait.
