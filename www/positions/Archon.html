�Sure, the Camarilla is pretty fucking far from perfect,
but it�s the only way to keep a society of supernatural
apex predators from tearing itself apart. That�s why I�m
willing to risk the Final Death to keep it going.�
� Jessica Kesch, Malkavian Archon
Archons are the empowered agents of a Justicar. They serve
as the eyes and ears of the Camarilla, representing the
first line of the Ivory Tower�s global justice. Justicars send
their Archons to investigate troubling rumors and discover
potential problems before there is a crisis. If an Archon finds
only minor trouble, she usually gives the local Prince or
Sheriff advice on how to handle the situation and a warning
that it had better be cleaned up when she returns. If she
finds serious trouble, she takes care of it personally. While
Archons may employ ghouls or younger Kindred to handle
drudge work, most Archons expect and are expected to be
totally self-sufficient, only contacting their patron Justicar
when their investigations are complete or to present regular
status reports.
An Archon is exempt from prosecution for violating the
Fifth and Sixth Traditions in direct service to her Justicar.
It is expected that an Archon shall ignore the Tradition of
Hospitality if doing so would endanger the completion of
her task. Should she find cause, an Archon is allowed to
kill with impunity in the name of the Justicar she serves. If
she finds exceptional problems, she escalates the situation
to her Justicar, possibly to the point of a Judicial Conclave.
Archons are not immune to the requirements of etiquette
or the anger of the Harpies. Should an Archon misstep
socially or politically, she will punished just like any other
officer. Such social punishment implies that the Archon has
overstepped her authority. Often, a Prince will punish an
Archon to send a message to a meddlesome Justicar whose
work clearly impedes upon Prince�s prerogatives under the
Second Tradition.
An Archon can go for weeks without contacting her
employer, especially when operating under cover. This habit
may have disastrous results if a Justicar fails to realize that
something untoward has happened to her Archon.
An Archon�s authority includes:
� Holding exemption from prosecution for violating the
Fifth and Sixth Traditions while in service
� Holding immunity from blood hunts other than from
Justicars, the Imperator, or the Inner Circle
� Appointing up to two Servires (permanent deputies)
into her service
� Holding status jurisdiction directly related to her
given task
An Archon gains the abiding status traits Commander and
Noble for her tenure in office.
