Imperator
Faced with increasing threats from the Sabbat, hunters
wielding True Faith, and their own internal strife, the
Camarilla’s Inner Circle recently decided to appoint a
military commander to lead the militia of the Camarilla.
This commander is known as the Imperator.
The Imperator acts as the voice of the Inner Circle on
matters of war, coordinating efforts between Princes and the
Justicars via his agents, known as the Myrmidons. The office
has the authority to grant clemency, for virtually all crimes,
to warriors who fight on behalf of the Imperator. A number
of Harpies disapprove of this new policy, claiming that it
distorts the order of society and weakens the power of the
Princes. Few have refused to acknowledge the Imperator’s
authority. The Imperator can only be removed from office by
the will of the Inner Circle and is immune from prosecution
from any lesser Camarilla office.
The Imperator’s authority includes:
• Raising and coordinating a militia to deal with a specific
threat or enemy, when sanctioned by the Inner Circle
• Granting clemency, even to those blood hunted or on the
Red List, to those who fight on behalf of the Imperator
• Appointing Myrmidions
• Issuing edicts from the Inner Circle changing global
policy of the sect, solely for the purpose of protection
• Calling and enforcing a global blood hunt on a sect
member who refuses to lend aid
• Holding immunity from the authority of any lesser
sect office
• Holding global status jurisdiction
The Imperator gains the abiding status traits Ascendant,
Authority, and Commander during his tenure in office. When
the Imperator expends a status to give an offending Kindred
the negative status Disgraced or Forsaken, this status can
only be removed by the Inner Circle, or by a Justicar during
a Judicial Conclave of the sect.
