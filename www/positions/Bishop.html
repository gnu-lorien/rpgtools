As a smaller position, a Bishop’s authority comes via an
ordained Archbishop or Cardinal. So long as that authority
formally announces the Bishop, it is not necessary that she
be ordained by a Blood Bath. Still, some are given a full
Auctoritas ceremony, particularly Bishops who are ordained
in very orthodox dioceses. On occasion, a less populous
diocese may be governed by a council of Bishops, rather
than a full Archbishop.
A diocese may have three to five Bishops, each tasked by
the Archbishop (or Cardinal, where there is no Archbishop)
to manage one aspect of that city’s administration. Such
posts may include a Bishop of War, a Bishop of Security, a
Bishop of Spirituality, a Bishop of Resources, and a Bishop of
Information, but Bishops may be styled and tasked in any way
the Archbishop prefers. A Bishop cannot appoint Templars,
but can call on her Archbishop’s Templars when she is in need.
Typically, a Bishop of Security maintains the diocese’s
communal haven. A Bishop of War trains local packs in
combat and strategy, and coordinates military activity. A
Bishop of Spirituality instructs packs in the Auctoritas Ritae,
and oversees Monomacy challenges within the diocese. A
Bishop of Information acts as a spymaster, keeping tabs on
founded packs, nomadic visitors, and non-Sabbat vampires
in the area. A Bishop of Resources maintains control over
the influences and peons of the mortal world.
If an Archbishop is compromised, a full quorum of the
diocese’s Bishops may declare the Archbishop position open
for challengers. The challengers compete (typically through
Monomacy), and the one who claims the title must seek
ordination by the Cardinal of the Holy See.
A Bishop’s authority includes:
• Carrying out the Archbishop’s will within the domain
• Performing ritae when the Archbishop authorizes it
• Fulfilling her specialization or administrative task
• Holding status jurisdiction in her Archbishop’s
physical domain
A Bishop gains the either the abiding status trait Blessed or
Enforcer (chosen at the beginning of each night), during
her tenure in office. If the Bishop was given a Blood Bath
upon taking office, she temporarily gains the abiding status
Ordained when at her local gathering, if the Archbishop is
not in attendance at the game.
