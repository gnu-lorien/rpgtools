The Primogen Council is usually limited to the single eldest
or most influential member of each pillar clan, which limits
the council membership to six or seven Kindred in most cases.
Nevertheless, many Primogen like to maintain a lieutenant or
executive assistant of sorts, as a means of displaying clan unity
and to help manage particularly numerous clan populations
within a domain. This assistant is often assigned to keep
track of tedious details that do not demand the Primogen’s
complete attention. In Great Britain and the United States,
the Primogen have adopted the term Whip from their mortal
legislatures to describe the Kindred serving under them. The
jockeying and maneuvering among these lesser Kindred can
be quite intense as the Primogen like to present the position of
Whip as a route to prestige and power. Primogen gloss over the
fact that there is room for only one Primogen in each clan, and
these subservient vampires will only get that post by leaving
for another domain or over the dead body of the current one.
A Whip gains no abiding status of her own, but temporarily
gains the abiding status Noble when at her local gathering, if
the Primogen is not in attendance.
