The function of a Sheriff is to serve as the Prince’s chief
enforcer, policing the Kindred community for violations of
the Traditions. Though Princes are increasingly employing
cautious, tactically savvy enforcers and investigators,
common wisdom continues to cast the Sheriff as the
Prince’s best thug.
In addition to repairing violations of the Masquerade – a
task made more vital and dangerous by the rise of public
media and the hunter threat – the Sheriff must always be
prepared to defend the domain in time of crisis. Sheriffs and
their deputies visit communal and trending hunting grounds
to ensure that everything is suitably quiet. They listen to
EMTs, the police, the local media, and similar sources for
rumors of suspicious occurrences.
During wartime, the Sheriff is often called upon to be
the local warlord, coordinating the domain’s actions
and personally leading the battle. A Sheriff may select
deputies to assist her in this task, granting them authority
for the evening. Most Sheriffs see the Scourge’s duties as
encroaching on their jurisdiction, so the two positions rarely
get along. The rest of the city’s Kindred usually just try to
stay out of their way.
A Prince typically expects the majority of her court officers
to use elegant solutions, but the Sheriff is allowed a certain
amount of leniency in this regard. Problems sometimes
require physical resolution, and as long as Final Death is
not reached, the Prince and the Primogen will look the
other way when the Sheriff bends the rules. If the object of
the Sheriff’s ire is disliked, the Harpy might even gleefully
reveal the details of her punishment to the entire court. A
crafty Sheriff knows where the line is between doing her job
and offending the court.
A Sheriff’s authority includes:
• Protecting and repairing the Masquerade
• Appointing up to two temporary deputies into her service
• Preparing and carrying out strategies for a military crisis
• Combatting the Sabbat or other enemies of the sect
• Protecting the Prince within her domain
• Holding status jurisdiction in her Prince’s physical domain
A Sheriff gains the abiding status traits Enforcer and
Privileged during her tenure in office.
