Elected by the Inner Circle to 13-year terms, the Justicars are
the global Camarilla authorities empowered to act as judge,
jury, and executioner. Each of the pillar clans of the Ivory
Tower seats a single Justicar. Justicars enjoy immense power
over Kindred society and the Camarilla. The greatest authority
that a Justicar possesses is the power to issue an edict, a formal
judicial review that clarifies how a Tradition shall henceforth
be interpreted or introduces a new lesser law of the Camarilla.
These dangerous vampires serve not only as grim judges and
agents of the Inner Circle, but also as leaders and protectors
of society, encouraging social discourse and alliances within
the sect. They sometimes call and manage conclaves for the
purpose of encouraging Camarilla Kindred to host salons,
creating a place for chance meetings that might otherwise
never occur. A right or wrong word from a Justicar at the
proper moment can be better coin than gold or status.
Justicars are regarded with awe and fear. No Kindred
dares to refuse them, even if it aids in that vampire’s own
destruction. The Justicars stride the Camarilla like colossi,
and the shadow they cast is long indeed.
Empowered by the Inner Circle, the Justicars have the
ability to ensure that an insane or criminally despotic Prince
is formally removed from power before she does too much
damage to the Traditions, or turns the tide of battle against
the Camarilla. A Justicar can automatically strip a Prince of
all abiding status traits related to that office. In addition, a
Justicar can announce a global blood hunt upon criminals
of the Camarilla. Such a global blood hunt can only be
removed by sanction of the Inner Circle. Justicars can also
propose new additions to the Red List to the Inner Circle
and offer bounties on behalf of their clans.
A Justicar welds great power within the Camarilla during
the term of her office, but she must leverage it carefully, lest
those she wronged seek revenge once she is released from
service. Rarely will a Justicar involve herself in domain
affairs until the problem is so great that the Masquerade is
truly in danger. If a domain’s problems spill out beyond its
borders to endanger other domains, an Archon may be sent
to investigate and resolve the matter.
Justicars can be formally removed from office by the will of the
Inner Circle; they are immune from prosecution from any lesser
Camarilla office. Should a Justicar prove to be too autocratic
or incompetent, a clever opponent may humiliate her via a
Motion to Censure at a Judicial or Grand Conclave. A Justicar
who has lost the favor of the assembly, despite her considerable
political advantages, is considered by the Inner Circle to be too
weak to be a viable officer; they are usually discharged. Such
an event is rare; it has only occurred twice in the history of
the Camarilla, most recently to Brujah Justicar Pascek shortly
before his murder at the hands of hunters in 2010.
A Justicar’s authority includes:
• Calling a Global, Judicial or Regional Conclave
• Issuing a writ to require the presence of any Accepted
sect member
• Issuing an edict to alter the laws of the sect
• Removing the praxis of a Prince, stripping her abiding
status
• Issuing blood hunts on criminals and enemies of the sect
• Holding immunity from prosecution from any lesser
sect office
• Appointing Archons into her service
• Appointing the host of a Conclave to be Primus Inter Pares
• Holding global status jurisdiction
A Justicar gains the abiding status traits Ascendant, Authority,
and Commander during her tenure in office. When a Justicar
brands an offending Kindred with the negative status
Disgraced or Forsaken, this status can only be removed by
the Inner Circle, the Imperator, or by a Justicar during a
Judicial Conclave of the sect.
