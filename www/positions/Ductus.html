Ducti attend to the operational, day-to-day activities of the
pack and serve as warleaders. They are responsible for the
combat training and functionality of the pack, as well as its
safety and security. In most packs, the Ductus is the primary
authority. However, in packs with a more religious bent, the
Priest may hold primary authority, so long as the pack is
not actively preparing for, or engaging in, combat. A Ductus
may administer physical punishment to any member of her
pack. For more information on sect punishments, see the
list on page 419.
A Ductus gains the abiding status trait Blessed during her
tenure. A Ductus holds status jurisdiction over the members
of her pack.
