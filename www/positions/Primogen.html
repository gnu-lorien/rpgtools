Jürgen von Verden, Prince of Magdeburg, is believed to
have coined the term Primogen. He recruited a number
of important elders to his Primogeniture Assembly to
provide counsel for his war efforts to take the old Kingdom
of Transylvania from the Tzimisce. Individual Princes,
wanting the support of local elders and other important
Kindred, shared their power with these councils. After the
Convention of Thorns, it became common for domains
to have a Primogen Council to ensure stability. In fact, it
became a matter of prestige for a Prince to have important
elders on her council as a show of strength.
The Primogens’ main authority is to socially monitor, reward,
or punish their clanmates within the domain. Primogen
carefully watch their peers to ensure against abuse of the
office’s powers. Primogen who boost the prestige of their
clans undeservedly and get caught will certainly receive
backlash from the Harpy.
Primogen speak for their clans during Primogen meetings and
at formal court. In modern nights, the Primogen Council acts as
an advisory council to the Prince. Traditionally, the Primogen
Council is drawn from the most influential member of each
pillar clan of the Camarilla. Occasionally, a Prince might offer
an influential member of a non-pillar clan a place on the
council. This is unusual, but is not considered scandalous, if
said Primogen is powerful and seen as a benefit to the Ivory
Tower. However, should this unusual Primogen fail, the Prince
pays the political price in terms of scandal from the Harpies.
The Courtesies of a domain determine exactly how a Primogen
is selected. Some domains may have their clans elect their
Primogen through democratic vote, while others seem to merely
reach a popular consensus amongst the elders of the clan.
The Prince has the right to refuse a Primogen seat to a clan
if it lacks sufficient population within the domain, or as
punishment for miscreant misbehavior. This is a dangerous
political maneuver, as it can lead to grudges and bad blood
between the Primogen and the Prince.
Wise Kindred visiting a new city will meet first with the
Primogen to learn the local Courtesies before seeking
Acknowledgement, lest they blunder into a social error.
A Primogen’s authority includes:
• Administering punishments or rewards to members of
her clan
• Advising and informing the Prince about recent events
• Speaking for the clan at meetings of the Primogen Council
• Allotting feeding territory to the members of her clan,
from territory granted to the clan by the Prince
• Holding jurisdiction over members of her clan who have
recently visited or dwell within her Prince’s domain.
A Primogen gains the abiding status trait Noble during her
tenure in office.

The Power of the Primogen: Removing the Prince
The power of the Prince over her domain is absolute as long as she holds praxis of the domain.
Should the Primogen Council stand united against their Prince, they have the ability to remove the
Prince without bloodshed.
The local Primogen Council must, as a group, expend four Noble abiding status, the first three to
symbolically strip all three positional abiding status from their Prince, and then the fourth to remove
her praxis. This is a unique usage of the Noble status, and it can only be performed by Primogen of
a domain upon the Prince of that same domain. Primogen who oppose the removal of the Prince can
expend their Noble status to cancel one of their rival Primogen’s disloyal rebellion.
Should the Primogen Council be successful in this political maneuver, the former Prince loses her
praxis, the related abiding status, and all of the rights of the position. The praxis remains unclaimed
and vacant until another seizes it or the former Prince forces the Primogen to submit to her will via
coercion or violence.
However, this tactic does not come without a price. Primogen who expended their Noble status to
remove the Prince must reaffirm their position as Primogen amongst their clan before they can regain
that abiding status.
