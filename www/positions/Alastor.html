An Alastor is an agent of the Inner Circle charged
with hunting down the Anathema: vampires who have
been added to the Camarilla’s Red List and targeted
for destruction by the entire sect. Should a vampire
who is not yet an Alastor manage to destroy one of the
Anathema, she is automatically press-ganged into service
as an Alastor. While the Archons answer directly to the
Justicars, the Alastors answer only to the Camarilla’s Inner
Circle. Any Kindred (even an Alastor) who diablerizes
an Anathema takes the victim’s place on the Red List.
Alastors have a mystical red tattoo (similar in appearance
to the Ankh of the Camarilla) placed on their right palm
to denote their position.
An Alastor’s authority includes:
• Entering any domain in the search for Anathema
• Holding exemption from prosecution for violating the
Fifth and Sixth Traditions while hunting Anathema
An Alastor gains the abiding status trait Commander during
her tenure in office.
