The term Seneschal once described a role in ancient noble
households charged with managing domestic arrangements,
overseeing servants, and administrating outlaying provinces.
In Camarilla domains, the Seneschal is traditionally the
Prince’s most trusted assistant, and she speaks for the Prince
in her absence. On any given night, the Seneschal must be
a capable manager, executive officer, proxy hostess, or any
one of a dozen other functions the Prince may require.
A Prince will often direct her Seneschal to screen Kindred
who wish an audience, forcing them to convince the
Seneschal of the discussion’s importance. Unwise Princes
may command their Seneschals to perform unpleasant
duties; this almost always comes back to haunt them later.
Others turn hapless Seneschals into scapegoats during
uncomfortable political situations, claiming the Seneschal
did not give the Prince accurate, complete, or timely
information. Most vampires try to curry favor with the
Seneschal, for this august Kindred usually has the ear of
the important vampires in the domain. While a Seneschal
may choose not to work directly against an offending
vampire, a clever one can easily filter the information she
puts forth so as to make the object of her ire appear a fool
or a threat to the Prince.
Serving as the focus for those who would speak to the Prince
allows the Seneschal access to an impressive amount of
information, and many manage to keep as well informed as
the Harpies. In certain cases, an informal rivalry may develop
between the Seneschal and the Harpies to determine who
has access to better gossip. Such competition is dangerous
for any Seneschal, for it is easy for other Kindred, from the
Keeper of Elysium to the Prince, to perceive her as a rival for
power and influence.
The primary advantage to taking this labor-intensive position
is that if the Prince dies or is cast out by the Primogen
without a clear contender for praxis, the Seneschal becomes
the legal Prince in the eyes of the Camarilla.
A Seneschal’s authority includes:
• Holding authority to act and speak in the Prince’s
stead, when the Prince is not in attendance or when
the Prince is absent from the domain
• Gaining the ear of the Prince: the Prince cannot refuse
to hear a request from the Seneschal. (Whether or not
the Prince grants the request is another matter, but she
cannot refuse the Seneschal the opportunity to make it.)
• Holding status jurisdiction over her Prince’s physical
domain
A Seneschal gains the abiding status trait Noble during
her tenure in office, and she temporarily gains the abiding
status Authority when at a local gathering, if the Prince is
not in attendance.
