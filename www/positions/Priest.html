The Priest is responsible for the spiritual growth of her packmates.
The Priest conducts ritae and is responsible for offering advice
and council to her packmates on Paths of Enlightenment,
whether through direct guidance or by ensuring the packmate
finds proper mentorship. Despite the title, Priests do not report
to, nor gain authority from, the clergy hierarchy. Priests must
learn three Auctoritas Ritae (the Creation Rites, the Vaulderie,
and the Monomacy). A Priest may order any member of her
pack to undergo a Rite of Contrition.
A Priest gains the abiding status trait Ordained during her
tenure in office. When a character fulfills the requirements
of the fleeting status trait Scholar, it may be awarded by that
characterâ€™s Priest, by expending her Ordained status. A Priest
holds status jurisdiction over the members of her pack.
