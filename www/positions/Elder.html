It is whispered that the true power of the Camarilla lies
squarely in the hands of the elders. This rank is not a formal
office, but is a globally recognized social station awarded to
those cunning and potent enough to walk the halls of power
and politics as an elder. Many elders privately feel that a
strong central Camarilla authority is unnecessary and that
any real attempt to impose more regulation on a bunch of
ancient and powerful Kindred would only meet with disaster.
Nor are they at all pleased by what many of them see as naked
power grabs by avaricious and self-interested Justicars.
These ancient Kindred subtly maneuver byzantine plots
behind the scenes in endless skirmishes in the Jyhad.
Elders often leverage their great power and influence out
of fear to oppress the young into their service, as many
bitterly remember the bloody nights of the Anarch Revolts.
Neonates naturally chafe under such treatment and grow
jealous of the elders’ positions and power. The sheer weight
of their prestige creates a glass ceiling that drives many
seeking their own fortunes to the Anarch Movement.
To be considered an elder of the Camarilla, a vampire must
be of a potent generation (Pretender Elder, Master Elder, or
Luminary Elder) and have been known to be active for at
least 300 years.
An elder of the Camarilla gains the abiding status traits
Confirmed, Established, and Privileged. Note: Kindred can
only claim abiding status from a single source at one time.
Serafino might be the Harpy of his domain and an elder of
the Camarilla, but he can only claim the benefits of one
source of abiding status at a time.
