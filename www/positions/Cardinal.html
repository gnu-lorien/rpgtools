Cardinals have the authority to administrate large
geographical territories known as a Holy See. Cardinals
are always members of founded packs within the territory
they control. Cardinals report directly to the Regent. A
Cardinal is expected to serve on the Consistory and
coordinate Archbishops within her territory. To ascend to
the rank of Cardinal, a sect member must be extremely
knowledgeable in the Auctoritas Ritae and be able to
perform the Blood Bath.
Cardinals are frightening authorities, with broad powers
constrained only by the limit of their territory and the
authority of the Regent himself. Most members of the Sabbat
never meet a Cardinal, but hear only rumors and whispers
about them, tales that would turn a mortal’s hair white.
A Cardinal’s authority includes:
• Ordaining (through the Blood Bath) Archbishops and
Bishops within her jurisdiction
• Performing Wild Hunts and Blood Feasts within her
Holy See
• Assisting and advising the Regent
• Ordering any member of her Holy See to undergo a
Rite of Contrition
• Appointing up to three Templars into her service
• Calling an ecumenical council of the Holy See
• Issuing letters patent to ratify the findings of an
ecumenical council
• Removing any Archbishop or Bishop within her
jurisdiction.
• Exiling a member of the Sabbat from her Holy See
(permanently or otherwise)
• Summoning a lesser member of the Black Hand or the
Inquisition (but cannot command them)
• Holding regional status jurisdiction within her Holy
See (or over nomads)
A Cardinal gains the abiding status traits Authority, Glorious,
and Sacrosanct during her tenure in office.
