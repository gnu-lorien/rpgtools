Elysium is a place designated by the Prince of a city as one of the
few places where Kindred can interact with their peers and be
reasonably secure from violence. It is an honor to be responsible
for such a sacred place. The Keeper of Elysium has impressive
powers, but can only use them within certain strictly delimited
boundaries. In the confines of Elysium, the Keeper has the
authority to take whatever actions she feels are necessary to
preserve the Masquerade and the sanctity of Elysium. Keepers
are charged with the physical security of Elysium as well as the
societal ramifications of what transpires there.
The Keeper of Elysium must approve all gatherings held in
Elysium and may deny, without notice, any function, event, or
party on Elysium if she believes that it would be a threat to the
Masquerade or the attending Kindred. Residents of a domain
derive prestige, power, and pleasure from events held in
Elysium. Kindred love to hold business dealings and entertain
visiting dignitaries from distant domains in impressive Elysiums
as a symbol of power for their domain. Prestige-conscious
social climbers request permission to host balls and exhibits in
a beautiful Elysium. And, of course, those who wish to speak
with the Prince must often enter Elysium to do so.
Additionally, the Keeper is expected to control the presence
of weapons within Elysium. As such, she has the right to
search any Kindred who requests entrance, and to deny
entrance to anyone she pleases under the authority of her
post. This includes refusing her Prince entry; the Keeper’s
powers overrule the Prince’s authority on Elysium grounds
(though exercising this authority capriciously or unwisely
almost always leads to problems).
A Keeper of Elysium’s authority includes:
• Removing weapons from Kindred on Elysium
• Using any force necessary to defend Elysium
• Exiling the undesirable from the Elysium
• Commanding all mortals (including Retainers)
within Elysium
• Holding immunity from prosecution from the Prince or
Harpy when in defense of Elysium
• Holding status jurisdiction in the Elysiums within her
Prince’s physical domain
A Keeper of Elysium gains the abiding status traits Enforcer
and Guardian during her tenure in office.
