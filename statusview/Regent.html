The Regent is the absolute theocratic leader of the Sabbat.
He shepherds the faith and doctrine of the Church of the
Dark Father. The Regent is the commander of the Sword of
Caine in its war against the Antediluvians and their pawns,
the Camarilla. Supported by the Consistory (an advisory
body made up of the Cardinals and Prisci), the Regent is
empowered to issue commands in the name of the Dark
Father. He is the final authority for the Black Hand and
the Inquisition: both orders obey the Regent’s dictates. The
Regent cannot be uninitiated. The post of Regent can only
be removed through a successful challenge of Monomacy,
during which the only acceptable result for the loser is death.
For more information on the Monomacy, see page 430.
The Regent can appoint or remove any member of the clergy.
He can appoint or remove a Seraph of the Black Hand and the
Grand Inquisitor of the Sabbat Inquisition, investing them with
authority or withdrawing the same. The Regent recommends
appointments to the Prisci Council and confirms new Prisci via
ritae, if the other Prisci approve that appointment.
The Regent’s authority includes, but is not limited to:
• Calling a synod of the sect
• Removing or imposing individual status bans
• Uninitiating any member of the Sabbat
• Performing Wild Hunts and Blood Feasts throughout
the Sabbat
• Issuing letters patent to ratify the findings of a synod
• Holding immunity from prosecution from any lesser
sect office
• Ordering any member of the Sabbat to undergo a Rite
of Contrition
• Ordaining (through the Blood Bath) any clergy post in
the sect
• Confirming a Prisci who has been appointed by the
Prisci Council
• Removing any member of the clergy from her position
• Appointing or removing the Seraph and Grand
Inquisitor posts
• Appointing up to five Templars into his service
• Declaring a full Crusade; the Regent is the sole title
holder capable of this act
• Summoning any member of the Black Hand or the
Inquisition and issuing commands to her
• Holding global status jurisdiction
The Regent’s power is both spiritual and political, but the
position is only as strong as the holder, and wields as much
authority as he commands respect. The current Regent, a
Coyote Gangrel named Temoch, earned the loyalty of the
sect through decisive action during the Nights of Turmoil.
He is a leader who many respect, though some fear the
fanaticism he brings to the post.
The Regent gains the abiding status traits Authority,
Commander, Ominous, and Sacrosanct during his tenure in
office. Ominous is an NPC-only abiding status trait granting
the highest level of command; nearly everything allowable
falls within its capacity. When the Regent expends status to
give an offending Cainite the negative status Disgraced or
Forsaken, this negative status can only be removed by himself
or through a joint effort of the Prisci Council. The Regent
can remove the acceptance of Initiated from any individual
within the Sabbat, without expending a status trait.
