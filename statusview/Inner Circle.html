Inner Circle
The Inner Circle is the secretive cabal, compromised of a
single member of every pillar clan, that controls the Ivory
Tower. It is the archetypical secret society, inspiring legends
for countless conspiracy theorists’ nightmares, exerting its
will subtly, with frightening effectiveness. Few know the
identities of the current membership of the Inner Circle,
but none can deny that these Kindred are the true political
hub around which the Camarilla revolves. None are certain
exactly how the members of the Inner Circle achieve their
position, except simply by surviving to be a ripe old age and
ascending to monstrous power.
Every 13 years, these secret masters meet in Vienna to
discuss potential threats to the Camarilla and the sect’s
future. Many believe that the Inner Circle takes an active
hand in guiding the Ivory Tower, directing the Justicars
as necessary and shifting the direction of the sect. Those
who have aroused the Inner Circle’s collective anger have
usually done so in spectacular fashion, resulting in the
greatest punishment that can be levied: a place on the Red
List, essentially guaranteeing the criminal an eternity-long
blood hunt.
Members of the Inner Circle can expend their status
namelessly, using the Justicars as their mouthpieces for
the expenditure. Often when they do this, they choose
to expend the status Ominous, which is only possessed by
the Inner Circle, in order to allow the politically savvy to
understand where the command originated.
The Inner Circle’s authority includes:
• Appointing or removing Justicars
• Determining the Ivory Tower’s political and social direction
• Ruling upon Camarilla-wide issues and doctrine
• Issuing edicts to alter the fundamental doctrine, law, or
custom of the sect
• Defining methods of judgment and punishment
• Naming individuals to the Red List
• Appointing or removing the Imperator
• Holding immunity from the authority of any lesser
sect office
• Appointing Alastors to the sect
• Holding global status jurisdiction
A member of the Inner Circle gains the abiding status traits
Ascendant, Authority, Commander, and Ominous during her
tenure in office. Ominous is an NPC-only abiding status trait
granting the highest level of command; nearly everything that
is allowable falls within its capacity. When a member of the
Inner Circle expends a status to give an offending Kindred
the negative status Disgraced or Forsaken, this status can only
be removed by another member of the Inner Circle.
