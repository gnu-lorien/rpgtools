The Scourge is charged with culling the city of undesirable
vampires, specifically those created without the Prince’s
permission; often these undesirables include Caitiff and
other thin-blooded vampires. Many cities have refused to
institute a Scourge, but a number of Princes leveraged the
fear of the infamous “Time of Thin Blood” prophesied in
the Book of Nod to add to their muscle. Princes sometimes
secretly use the Scourge to eliminate enemies.
Some claim that the station of Scourge is an ancient post
dating back to the Dark Ages resurrected in modern times,
others argue that it is an entirely new creation. Regardless
of the historical truth, in cities where a Scourge stalks
the night, she is a mythic bogeyman and source of fear for
illegitimate vampires.
The Ivory Tower treats the position with a certain amount
of disdain. Many humane Kindred actively shun those who
serve as Scourge, calling them unredeemable slaughterers.
The few Kindred who attempt to keep the Scourge fully
integrated in Camarilla society are rarely appreciated by
either the Scourge or their fellow Kindred.
On a typical night, a Scourge may travel to dismal, less-
populated parts of the city. There, she searches for signs
of fugitives, such as rats and stray dogs drained of blood
or street people who are more jumpy than usual. Some
Scourges set traps, while others hunt Caitiff down like
beasts. Some Princes demand the prey be brought back alive
for questioning, in hopes of learning who sired the childe.
Others are content to see the heads or fangs of the night’s
take. Occasionally, sometimes based on a rumor or a tip,
sometimes not, the Scourge visits the city’s regular Kindred,
looking to see if they are harboring illegally created childer.
On such occasions, wise Scourges are even more cautious
than normal, since older vampires are far more cunning and
dangerous than the fledglings they normally hunt.
A Scourge’s authority includes:
• Destroying vampires who are not Acknowledged by
the Camarilla
• Combatting the Sabbat or other enemies of the sect
• Holding status jurisdiction in her Prince’s physical domain
A Scourge gains the abiding status trait Enforcer during her
tenure in office.
