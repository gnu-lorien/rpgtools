Being appointed a Templar is a great honor. It conveys the
obvious favor of a sect leader and endorses a vampire’s
fighting skills. Receiving the position of Templar is also
seen as a formal declaration of support for that sect leader
from the Templar’s entire pack. Templars perform a variety
of duties, usually related to combat or to the protection
of the clergy member they serve. A Templar can disobey a
command given by an officer who is lower in rank than the
one who appointed her, so long as she is directly following
an order from the person she serves.
The term Paladin was once interchangeable with the title
of Templar, until the line blurred between clergy guardians
and Inquisition Paladins. Since then, the term for a clergy’s
guardian has preferentially become Templar, and the term
Paladin is reserved for Inquisition agents alone.
A Templar (or Paladin) gains the abiding status trait of
Enforcer during her tenure in office.
