A neonate Embraced into the strength of the Ivory Tower
might find it difficult to imagine the historical world of the
ancient Camarilla. The founding of the Camarilla caused a
number of vampire customs to be codified into a complex,
world-wide system that invests a great deal of power into
the hands of a position known as Harpy. In the world of the
Camarilla, where the halls of power can often resemble an
old boys’ club, the Harpy is as close to an equal-opportunity
position as one may find. A capable Harpy is an arbiter of
social propriety, an enforcer of Camarilla dogma, and a
calculating favor broker who ensures that the local boon
economy is secure.
Boons and scandals have long been part of Kindred society,
and since ancient times, Harpies have ensured that the
social mores were respected and boons were recorded.
A wily Harpy can whisper a word in the right ear and cause
untold damage to a Kindred’s reputation; for this reason
alone, they are respected. This respect gives the Harpies
a certain amount of protection against violent retribution.
Woe to the base villain who kills a Harpy for performing
her duty! Every Harpy in the world would band together to
destroy such a threat. However, those who live by the social
sword can likewise die by it. A disgraced Harpy is often
punished twice as harshly by her former peers because she
should know better.
Any Kindred with the right combination of wit, maliciousness,
and savoir-faire may insinuate herself into the position. Of
course any pretender who tries but falls short will find that
news of this particular solecism has reached the ears of all
but the most bucolic of domains.
Many neonates question the actual power of the Harpies,
claiming that a Kindred with the strength to ignore the
Harpy’s japes can simply enforce her will through violence.
Such naïveté rarely lasts long. All of the elders have a
vested interest in maintaining social power. The Harpy’s
work keeps conflicts confined to the social arena, and that,
in turn, keeps elder vampires safer. These young vampires
learn the error of their ways.
A Harpy is the apex social predator of the domain. If the
Harpy feels especially vicious, she can encourage the court
to politically snub a social outcast, punishing anyone who
is kind to her target in public. She does so by declaring it
scandalous to merely speak to said vampire in public. A
vampire ostracized like this is in an impossible situation.
She can’t leave without being turned into even more of a
laughingstock, and staying only invites more frustration as
she endures barely audible titters from those in on the snub.
Further, frenzying due to taunts leads to severe punishment.
Kindred are supposed to be able to control their Beasts,
and the weak should stay at home. Biting insults can be
more devastating to ancient vampires than a blade or gun,
especially in an arena where wit is the only means of attack,
such as an Elysium or a Prince’s court. A vampire who relies
solely on brute force is helpless before a Harpy’s assault. A
particularly cunning barb will be picked up and repeated by
dozens of other Kindred, humiliating the target wherever she
appears. (Some neonates create spectacular internet MEMEs
and share them between allies to amuse themselves.)
These techniques might seem mild compared to, say, ripping
someone’s throat out with supernatural speed and strength,
but remember that the Camarilla is a society where violence
against Acknowledged members of the court is forbidden,
except in special circumstances.
The Harpy may sponsor other vampires as her assistants,
as Lesser Harpies, to bring news, gossip, and information
her way. A Harpy with two or more assistants is referred
to by the title “Master (or Mistress) of Harpies,” or simply
“Master (Mistress) Harpy.”
As the complex social rules of status developed within the
Camarilla, the Harpies naturally asserted their authority over
standing. In early nights, this authority caused a number of
problems. What if several Harpies disagreed? How do you
determine if a Harpy is important enough to remove standing?
Ironically, the mortal world faced a similar problem with the
growing banking industry. The solution for one mirrored
the other. Harpies sought support from the Primogen of
their domains, much like banks sought backing from their
governments for legitimacy. These nights, the alliance
between the positions of Primogen and the Harpy serves as
a counterbalance to the office of the Prince. A Harpy must
have backing from the Primogen to maintain her position.
The Primogen need a strong Harpy to ensure their power.
The Primogen Council formally selects the Harpy by a simple
majority vote. As long as the Harpy maintains the Primogen
Council’s support, she continues to serve in her office.
A Harpy’s authority includes:
• Brokering and negotiating boons on behalf of members
of the domain
• Maintaining the official record of boons for the domain
• Judging and mediating conflicts over boons for the domain
• Advising and informing the Prince about recent events
• Administering praise or scandal to the Kindred of the
domain
• Appointing up to two Lesser Harpies (permanent
deputies) into her service
• Exiling the undesirable from the domain
• Monitoring and enforcing status expenditures within the
jurisdiction of her Prince’s domain
A Harpy (or Master Harpy) gains the abiding status traits
Prominent, Noble, and Guardian during her tenure in the
office. A Lesser Harpy gains no abiding status of her own,
but temporarily gains the abiding status Guardian at her
local gathering, if the Master Harpy is not in attendance.
