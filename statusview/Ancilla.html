The largest body of vampires within the Camarilla are
ancillae. To be considered an ancilla of the Camarilla, a
vampire must be of the 10 th generation or better, and have
been known to be active for at least 50 years.
An ancilla of the Camarilla gains the abiding status trait
Confirmed. Note: Kindred can only claim abiding status from
a single source at one time. Duela might be the Primogen of
her clan and an ancilla of the Camarilla, but she can only
claim the benefits of one source of abiding status at a time
