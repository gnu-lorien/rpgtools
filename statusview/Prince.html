“You’ve been reborn into a sect hundreds of years old,
whose leaders convinced the world our existence is a fabrication.
Suffice to say, there are some expectations. In exchange for the
birthright and education you have already been given,
you will adhere to our laws and customs — the Traditions.
And should you wish to advance in our society,
you will have to impress me.”
— Paul Walker, Brujah Elder,
Prince of Kenosha
The Prince is the vampire who claims the right to rule over
a domain. A Kindred becomes Prince by claiming praxis,
and, if successful, she has the freedom to do as she wishes
within her domain — at least in theory. In modern nights,
the title of Prince is synonymous with the Camarilla, but
the designation stretches back to the feudal structures of
the Dark Ages and is occasionally used by vampires who
predate the Camarilla. The title Prince applies to rulers of
either gender; despite the title’s patrician origins, modern
usage of the term owes more to Machiavelli than to royalty.
A Prince keeps the peace and creates local laws known
as the Curiosities; she also does whatever is required to
keep the city orderly and safe from incursion. A Prince
wears many hats, including diplomat, commander in chief,
lawmaker, patron of the arts, and judge. While her authority
derives from the Traditions, her success as a Prince depends
as much if not more on her ability to manage a domain
full of supernatural nocturnal predators through skillful
application of influence, persuasion, personal charisma, and
sheer force of will. Some Princes are indeed despotic tyrants,
but few can maintain their praxis for long without some
talent for able administration.
Historically, the position was claimed by the strongest vampire
in a given region, ruling as she wished. Slowly, after the
Convention of Thorns, the Camarilla reshaped the modern
perception of a Prince, including the addition of an advisory
council of Primogen. Over time, certain privileges and
responsibilities became attached to the position, either at the
whim of the ruler or the demands of the ruled. The position
reached its familiar modern form during the Renaissance.
The true capability and powers of a Prince vary from domain
to domain. A powerful Prince might elect to micromanage
the entire city personally, while a less-capable Prince may be
a figurehead for a potent Primogen council. The Camarilla
has no set policy for succession and will usually recognize the
most powerful vampire who wants to claim the title of Prince.
A Prince rules absolutely, until she loses power and another
takes her place via political maneuver or a bloody coup d’état.
If a Prince shows herself incapable of maintaining the safety
of the city against incursion, she may be forced to abdicate by
her citizens or via a Judicial Conclave.
If the Prince suffers the Final Death or is forced from office
without a clear successor, the position usually falls to the
Seneschal. More than one hapless Prince has “accidently”
gone to Final Death, allowing an ambitious Seneschal to
ascend to the position.
A Prince’s authority includes:
• Interpreting and enforcing the Traditions within the
domain
• Acknowledging all Kindred arriving in the domain
• Exiling the undesirable
• Allotting feeding territory to the clans of the domain
• Declaring or revoking Elysium
• Issuing blood hunts on criminals and enemies of the
sect
• Holding Right of Destruction in accordance with the
Sixth Tradition
• Sanctioning breaches of the Traditions (granting the
right to Embrace, and so forth)
• Punishing miscreants for violating Traditions, especially
the Masquerade
• Holding status jurisdiction over her domain
A Prince gains the abiding status traits Authority, Commander,
and Sovereign during her tenure in office. She can offer the
acceptance of Acknowledged to any individual within her
territory, without expending a status trait.
